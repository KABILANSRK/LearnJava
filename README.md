# Java Small Projects Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of small Java projects designed for learning and practicing various Java concepts. Each project focuses on specific programming techniques, problem-solving skills, and real-world application scenarios.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Calculator

```
A simple arithmetic calculator that supports basic operations such as:

-> Addition
-> Subtraction
-> Multiplication
-> Division
```
## Concepts Practiced:
Through this project, I have learnt:

- Conditional statements (if, switch)
- User input handling
- Basic OOP (Encapsulation, Class Design)

### 2. Mark Evaluation (Grades)

```
A program to evaluate student grades based on their marks. Features include:

-> Determining the grade for a given mark
-> Classifying marks into specific ranges (A, B, C, D, E)
```
## Concepts Practiced:
Through this project, I have learnt:

- Conditional statements (if, switch)
- User input error handling

### 3. Array Operations

```
A program that performs the following operations on an array of numbers:

-> Find the minimum and maximum values
-> Calculate the average of all elements
-> Sort the array
```
## Concepts Practiced:
Through this project, I have learnt:

- Array manipulation
- Looping constructs (for, while)
- Sorting algorithms

### 4. String Operations

```
A program for basic string manipulations:

-> Reverse a string
-> Check if a string is a palindrome
-> Identify vowels and consonants in a string
-> Convert a string to uppercase
```
## Concepts Practiced:
Through this project, I have learnt:

- String handling (charAt, toUpperCase)
- Iteration through strings
- Logical problem-solving

### 5. Employment Management

```
A mini-project to manage employee records:

-> Add, remove, and view employee details
-> Store employee details using ArrayList
-> Search for employees based on criteria (e.g., ID or name)
```
## Concepts Practiced:
Through this project, I have learnt:

- Use of ArrayList for dynamic data storage
- Object-oriented principles (Encapsulation, Class Design)
- Comparator for sorting


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Running the Programs

#### Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/KABILANSRK/LearnJava.git
```
#### Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd Java-Projects
```

#### Compile and run the .java files:
```
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

# What I have Learnt

#### By exploring these projects, I have gained hands-on experience with:

- Java basics and intermediate programming techniques
- Working with arrays, strings, and collections (ArrayList)
- Error handling and debugging
- Real-world problem-solving using Java
